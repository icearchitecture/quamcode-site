# ðŸŽ¨ Making Your Spline Scene Transparent

## The Issue
Your Spline scene has a black background that's blocking the website content behind it.

## Solution: Edit in Spline

### 1. **Open Your Chips Scene in Spline**
- Go to your Spline dashboard
- Open the "Chips" project

### 2. **Change Background Settings**
Look for these options in Spline:

**Option A: Scene Settings**
- Click on the scene/canvas (empty area)
- In the properties panel (right side)
- Find "Background" or "Environment"
- Set to "Transparent" or turn off background

**Option B: Export Settings**
- When exporting/sharing
- Look for "Transparent Background" checkbox
- Enable it

### 3. **Alternative: Use a Different Scene**
If transparency isn't working, you could:
- Use a scene with lighter colors
- Create a new scene with transparent background
- Use one of the other community scenes

## Quick Fix (Already Applied)
I've added:
- 50% opacity to the Spline container
- Stronger gradient overlay
- Better z-index layering

This should help, but editing the Spline scene directly would be best!
