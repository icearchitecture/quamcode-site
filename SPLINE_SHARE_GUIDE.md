# ðŸš€ Getting Your Spline Public URL

## Steps in the Spline Editor:

### 1. **Look for the Share button**
- Usually in the top-right corner
- Might look like an arrow or "Share" text
- Could be in the menu (three dots)

### 2. **Click Share â†’ Public URL**
Options you might see:
- "Viewer" - This is what we want!
- "Public Link"
- "Get Public URL"

### 3. **Copy the Viewer URL**
It should look like:
```
https://my.spline.design/[some-id]
```
or
```
https://prod.spline.design/[some-id]
```

### 4. **Settings to check:**
- âœ… Make sure it's set to "Public"
- âœ… "Allow embedding" if there's an option
- âœ… "Viewer" mode (not editor)
